1. Timer Configuration (100Hz)
  The system clock is configured at 16 MHz. To achieve a 100Hz frequency:
  Prescaler (PSC): $1599$ (Divides clock by $1600 \rightarrow 10$ kHz)
  Auto-Reload (ARR): $99$ (Divides $10$ kHz by $100 \rightarrow 100$ Hz)
  MMS (Master Mode Selection): Set to Update Event to act as a Trigger Output (TRGO) for the ADC.
2. ADC & DMA:
  ADC1: Configured in 12-bit mode, triggered by the rising edge of TIM2_TRGO.
  DMA2 Stream 0: Operates in Circular Mode to continuously transfer the ADC Data Register (DR) to a memory buffer.
  Interrupts: A DMA Transfer Complete Interrupt triggers the UART transmission logic
3. UART Transmission
  Arduino UNO used as a usb to ttl bridge 
  Baud rate=115200
4. Microcontroller: STM32F411CEU6 (Black Pill).
5. Debugger: ST-LINK V2.
6. The following results were verified using STM32CubeIDE Live Expressions and console
